    <strong><p>we know the Scouts of Squad 104 have been in the corps for three years now. After those events, their next mission is to accompany Captain Levi as he escorts and protects Eren and Historia. The pieces are coming together to find the answers behind why the world is the way it is, and at the same time, Scout activity is being restricted outside the walls. The future looks grim.

            The episode starts with lightheartedness and humor that balances out the drama and seriousness that occurs later on. It’s nice to see these characters that we’ve gotten to know over the last few years finally have a moment of respite as well, and to revisit some running gags.
            
            Then the drama comes back in full swing. Like last season, the story is jumping between Hange and Levi’s squads. This episode narrows its sights on Levi’s squad for the most part, but Hange and her squad comes into play for some significant story details. It will be interesting to see how these two teams end up working together in this arc, how they’ll have to split apart, and just how many enemies the Scouts will have by the end of this season.</p></strong>
