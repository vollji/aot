    <h1>SEASON 2</h1>
    <strong><p>The second season starts with the Female Titan captured and the shit hitting the fan rather quickly after that. We had no unnecessary recaps (they waste valuable screening time). Everything contributed to the actual plot, both flashbacks and events were used to explain what is happening.

            The same questions, however, remain: What are these Titans and why do they want to eradicate humanity? Why are there humans that can transform into them? Who is the real enemy and who is behind all this? The main characters, such as Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Reiner, Bertolt etc. are reintroduced into the plot and new threats and enemies come into the spotlight, such as the weird Beast Titan. The whole season is surrounded by the mysterious background of certain characters, and as the story progresses, we learn more and more about their motivations. In other words, I would say that this season is more character- and story-oriented than the actual war against the Titans.
